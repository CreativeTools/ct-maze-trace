##Compability
The plugin has only been tested with C4D R14.

##Installation
Unzip the folder to your _CINEMA/plugins/_ folder and restart CINEMA.
After extraction the files (cinema4dsdk.cdl, cinema4dsdk.vcproj, etc.) should lie in _CINEMA/plugins/Maze Trace/_.

##Usage
The plugin contains two objects that can be found under the _plugins->Maze Trace_ menu entry, _Maze Trace_ and _Point Generator_.
###Maze Trace
A generator (place objects under it) that takes polygon objects and connects their points in interesting ways (it tries na√Øvely to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by connecting each point to its nearest neighbor).

###Point Generator
A helper object that generates random points on the surface of an input object. Since the output object only consists of points it will not show up in the 3d view.

##Settings
###Maze Trace
* Maximum Segment Length
  * Delete segments longer than this. Useful for getting rid of occasional lines connecting different parts of the model.
* Relative
  * When checked the _Maximum Segment Length_ is a multiplier of neighboring points, otherwise it's an absolute length.

###Point Generator
* Num Points
  * The number of points to generate on the surface of the object
